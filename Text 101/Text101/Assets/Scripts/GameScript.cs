/**
Order after order you fulfil

Order after order you quickly cook the meal. Your feet can barely hold you up after hours of tirelessly satisfying the customers. 

Your co-worker comes over and asks:
“Hey chef! Would you like a hand?”

What do you say?
1.	“Oh god yes, I’m barely holding it together here”
2.	“No no I got it handled!”
